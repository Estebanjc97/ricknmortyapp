# Skills Showcase: Application with Angular SSR and NestJS

This project is an application designed to demonstrate my software development skills using Angular with Server Side Rendering (SSR), NestJS, and deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Project Description

The application is built to showcase how to combine modern front-end and back-end technologies to create robust and scalable applications. It uses Angular for client-side development with SSR through Angular Universal, while NestJS provides a scalable and efficient framework for the server.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular with SSR**: For improved user experience and better SEO.
- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable server-side applications.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Used for deploying and managing the application's infrastructure.

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Enhances performance and search engine optimization.
- **Modular Architecture**: Utilizes Angular and NestJS for a clean and scalable structure.
- **Automated Deployment on GCP**: Implementation in the cloud for high availability.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 20.10.0)
- npm (version 10.8.2)
- Angular CLI (version 19.0.0)
- Google Cloud Account

## Installation and Setup
